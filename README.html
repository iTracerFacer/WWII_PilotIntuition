    <p>A Moose Framework-based script for DCS World that simulates WWII-era pilot intuition and reconnaissance, enhancing immersion in historical aviation scenarios by providing realistic target spotting without modern aids.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The WWII Pilot Intuition System bridges the gap between modern DCS gameplay and historical WWII aviation. In an era without radar or advanced avionics, pilots relied on visual scanning, formation flying, and intuition to maintain situational awareness. This script recreates that experience by alerting players to nearby air and ground threats through voice-like messages and optional visual markers.</p>
    <p>Whether flying solo or in formation, players receive timely warnings about bandits, ground units, and tactical situations, promoting better tactics and deeper immersion in WWII-themed missions.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Detection Ranges</strong>: This core feature simulates historical WWII reconnaissance by dynamically adjusting spotting distances based on formation flying and environmental conditions. Detection ranges for air and ground targets are boosted when flying in close formation with wingmen, reflecting how pilots in WWII relied on mutual support for better situational awareness. For instance, a solo pilot has base detection ranges (e.g., 5km for air targets, 3km for ground). In a 2-ship formation (two pilots flying within 1km of each other), ranges double to 10km air and 6km ground. A 4-ship formation triples them to 15km air and 9km ground, up to a maximum multiplier of 6x. Environmental factors further modify this: at night (22:00-06:00), ranges are reduced by 50%; bad weather can apply an additional 30% penalty. This encourages tactical formation flying and adapts to real-world conditions, making solo flights more challenging and formations more rewarding.</li>
        <li><strong>Realistic Messaging</strong>: Simulates pilot radio calls for spotting bandits, ground threats, and formation feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Formation Integrity Monitoring</strong>: Alerts for wingmen presence and formation status.</li>
        <li><strong>Dogfight Assistance</strong>: Warnings for merging bandits, tail threats, head-on encounters, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Markers</strong>: Optional smoke or flare markers for spotted targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Scanning Toggles</strong>: Separate controls for air and ground target detection, available globally (mission-wide) and per-player.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Customization</strong>: Configurable settings via in-game F10 menu, including per-player overrides for scanning preferences and alert frequency modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Awareness</strong>: Reduced detection ranges at night or in bad weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer Support</strong>: Works in both single-player and multiplayer environments.</li>
    </ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <h3>In-Game Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>F10 Menu</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Settings</strong>: Mission-wide toggles for active messaging, markers, and air scanning.</li>
                <li><strong>Per-Player Settings</strong>: Individual controls under "Pilot Intuition" for dogfight assist, markers, air scanning preferences, alert frequency (Normal/Quiet/Verbose), and ground targeting (scan and select targets to mark).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Alerts</strong>: Receive voice-like messages for detected threats, formation changes, and compliments (based on your enabled scans).</li>
        <li><strong>On-Demand Summaries</strong>: Request situation summaries via menu options.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gameplay Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formation Flying</strong>: Fly close to wingmen to increase detection ranges. This is a key tactical element inspired by WWII aviation, where formations provided mutual spotting support. For example, maintaining a tight 2-ship formation boosts your air detection range from 5km to 10km, allowing you to spot bandits twice as far. In larger formations like a 4-ship flight, ranges can reach 15km, giving you a significant advantage in reconnaissance and defense. Stay within 1km of your wingmen to qualify for these bonuses—formations enhance capabilities but require discipline to maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>: Be aware that night and bad weather reduce spotting distances. At night, detection ranges are halved, simulating reduced visibility without modern aids. Bad weather applies additional penalties, making formation flying even more critical for maintaining awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dogfights</strong>: Use the system for merge warnings and tactical advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground Attacks</strong>: Use on-demand ground scanning to detect and mark specific targets. Scan lists up to 5 nearby targets, then select which one to mark with smoke/flares.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Scanning</strong>: Toggle air scanning on/off via F10 menu. Use "Ground Targeting" submenu to scan for nearby ground targets and select specific ones to mark.</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Frequency</strong>: Adjust alert frequency to "Quiet" for fewer messages in busy situations or "Verbose" for more detailed feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>The script uses a global configuration table <code>PILOT_INTUITION_CONFIG</code> for easy customization. Edit the values in <code>Moose_WWII_PilotIntuition.lua</code> before loading the mission. Players can override global settings via the F10 menu for personalized experience.</p>
    <h3>Key Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Detection Ranges</strong>: Adjust base ranges for air and ground targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Multipliers</strong>: Set environmental factors like night and weather penalties.</li>
        <li><strong>Messaging</strong>: Control cooldowns and enable/disable features.</li>
        <li><strong>Markers</strong>: Choose marker type and duration.</li>
        <li><strong>Scanning Toggles</strong>: Enable/disable air scanning globally (players can override individually). Ground scanning is on-demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Dogfight Assist</strong>: Toggle assistance and set thresholds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For detailed parameter descriptions, refer to the comments in the script.</p>
